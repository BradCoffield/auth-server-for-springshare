  "description":
    "A simple webserver with Node and Express. You customize the code with your authentication key etc. Then you can make calls to it as if you were making them directly to Springshare and then get the desired results back. At its core it does two things: Authenticate with Springshare's OAUTH 2.0 server and then passthrough your request to the appropriate API and return results in JSON. Please note, neither I nor this code is affiliated with or sponsored by Springshare.",
